# BudgetTracker

The Budget Tracker application is a dynamic tool that can be used to track and monitor your monthly spending habits.  Each month, the user may create an estimated budget calculated from estimated expenses, income, and additional funds by way of direct input from the user.  Then, the user may add any gains and losses into that monthâ€™s tracker to further monitor their budget through two separate views as the month continues on.
